Project Summary:

This ant game was part of my CIS61, Object Oriented Programming class. The GUI was provided, however, the game's mechanics were not.
Mechanic creation included making a rail for gameplay, unit movement, adding/removing units from the game, win/lose conditions, and unit creation.
The project's emphasis was on manipulating instances using classes. Each Bee or Ant has its instance and once deployed are completely independent.

The benefit of working with classes is that you can have multiple similar instances however each one deployed is unique. Uniqueness is important especially for this game because, of all the different types of units. We have ants vs. bees, but there are harvester ants, ant long throwers, ant queens, fire ants, etc. Each ant has the same base stats/functions, however, each ant has its special abilities that require a unique instance separate from the base stats and or class.


How to Play:
- Similar to "Plants Vs. Zombies", you gain 1 food per 1 uptick of time. Food acquisition can be increased with "Harvester ants", which adds +1 to food for every 1 uptick.
- Food is used to deploy more ants, some ants have higher food requirements than others. 
- Remove all Bees from the rail, using ants to win.
